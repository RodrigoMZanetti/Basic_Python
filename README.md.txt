This repository contains my practice exercises in Python, covering basic programming concepts such as:

- Variables and input/output
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions
- Basic projects (triangle checker, base converter, etc.)

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to practice Python programming and keep track of my learning journey.  
Each file (`ex036.py`, `ex037.py`, etc.) represents a different exercise.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SeuUsuario/NomeDoRepositorio.git
